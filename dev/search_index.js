(This approximation ratio applies to the geometric mean of agent utilities, not the raw product.) The result will also be envy-free up to any item (EFX).\n\nThe algorithm follows a straightforward greedy allocation procedure, where in each iteration, the most valuable item is allocated to the agent with the lowest utility.

The algorithm finds MNW allocations in polynomial time for binary additive valuations, i.e., where each agent values any given object at 0 or 1 (e.g., an Additive{BitMatrix}). It also works in a more general setting, where value(V, i, S), for any given i, is a concave function of the number of items g in S for which value(V, i, g) == 1.\n\nThe original algorithm builds on an initial allocation, but does not specify what this allocation should be. It also does not deal with the case where one or more agents ends up with zero utility; in fact the procedure will not work even if we start with two or more agents with zero utility in the intial allocation. The strategy followed here is the same as that of Caragiannis et al., where a maximum cardinality set of agents achieving positive utility is found using bipartite matching (with no fairness considerations). The remaining items are randomly allocated to agents among these that value them, if any. Remaining agents and items are ignored by the procedure.\n\nFollowing the algorithm of Barman et al., the tie-breaking procedure (Algorithm 1) of Halpern et al. is used, where the MNW allocation is transformed into the lexicographically greatest MNW, according to some ordering of the agents, providing group-strategyproofness (GSP) in addition to the EF1 and PO guarantees that follow from MNW. By default, the agent ordering/priority is random; if this randomization is turned off (with randpri set to false), the default ordering is used, with agent 1 receiving the highest priority, etc.\n\nnote: Note\nDespite the use of randomization here, by default, this is the deterministic procedure of Halpern et al. They also describe a randomized procedure, which functions in an entirely different manner.\n\nFinally, if the complete argument is set to true, the allocation is completed with fill_even! (which means that some agents that must necessarily get a utility of zero can still receive items valued zero, if that evens out the bundle cardinalities). Note that this undermines the GSP guarantee, which requires that these items be discarded. The return value is a named tuple with the fields alloc (the Allocation) and mnw (the Nash welfare, ignoring agents with zero utility).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#Allocations.alloc_ghss18_4-Tuple{Submodular, Any}","page":"Reference","title":"Allocations.alloc_ghss18_4","text":"alloc_ghss18_4(V::Submodular, MMSs)\n\nThe fourth algorithm (Algorithm 4) described by Ghodsi et al. in the 2018 paper Fair allocation of Indivisible Goods: Improvements and Generalizations.

The algorithm finds a 1/3-approximate MMS allocation for a given submodular instance. The method starts by overestimating the MMS of each agent and slowly decreasing the MMS of specific agents until alloc_ghss18_4 returns an allocation.\n\nThe amount that the MMS of an agent should be reduced by in each iteration is not specified by Ghodsi et al. One can show that if the factor is 1/(1 + 1/x), where x ≥ 3n - 1, then the algorithm will successfully find a 1/3-approximate MMS allocation. One way to show this, is to modify Lemma 4.6 in their paper to assume that each of the bundles Sᵢ is valued at least 1/(1 + 1/x). Using this modified version of Lemma 4.6, one can modify the proof of Theorem 4.7 to show that as long as x ≥ 3n - 1, the change in expectance from moving an item is at least 1/(3m).

First the instance is reduced to an ordered normalized instance where each good is worth less than 1/2. While there are more than one agent remaining, the algorithm creates a bundle with the textcategoryn lowest-valued items in each category. Repeatedly, it converts each of these to the highest-valued remaining item in the category until it either runs out of items to convert or an agent values the bundle at least 1/2. If the procedure runs out of items to convert, it adds the highest-valued remaining item in each category, in order, to get textcategoryn items from each category.  After each such item is added, the value is again checked for each agent. Since the instance was ordered normalized and without items worth 1/2 or more, the bundle created will always be worth more than 1/2 to one of the remaining agents before the procedure runs out of items to add to it or convert from low- to high-valued.\n\nAnother approximation ratio, α, can be supplied.
