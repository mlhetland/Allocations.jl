## Traits ####################################################################

# Traits are implemented manually, using the [Tim Holy Traits Trick][1]. In
# particular, a "constructor" for the abstract supertype is used as the trait
# function. When adding a trait to an abstract type or a type with a type
# parameter, make sure to use the `<:` operator. E.g., for `SomeType{T}`, use:
#
#   SomeTrait(::Type) = SomeTraitDefault()
#   SomeTrait(::Type{<:SomeType}) = SomeTraitValue()
#
# The return value is generally added at the end of the original argument list
# when dispatching on the trait, using a modified function name (among other
# things, to avoid ambiguities in dispatch):
#
#   foo(x) = _foo(x, SomeTrait(x))
#
# A version taking an instance should also be defined, as in [base Julia][2].
#
#   SomeTrait(instance) = SomeTrait(typeof(instance))

Indicate whether a constraint instance or type is symmetric or asymmetric

`Symmetric` and `Asymmetric` are empty concrete subtypes of `Symmetry`). A
symmetric constraint is one that is invariant under permutation of the agents,
while an asymmetric constraint is not. That is, an asymmetric constraint is one
that permits individual variations in the constraints placed on the bundles of
different agents.

An instance has the same asymmetry as its type, and by default, this is
`Symmetric()`.

"""
    struct Allocation <: Any

A mapping `A` from agents `i` to their assigned bundles `bundle(A, i)`. Agents

`Allocation` also maintains an inverse mapping, from items `g` to their set of
owners, `owners(A, g)`. To keep these in sync, the bundles should be modified
using `give!` and `deny!`, rather than altering the bundle sets directly.

`Allocation`s support iteration (along with `length` and `isempty`), which acts
as for a map from agents to bundles, i.e., it generates a series of pairs `i =>
S`, where `i` is an agent, and `S` is the corresponding bundle.

## Reductions ################################################################


"""
    mutable struct Reduction{S, T, I, G}

A reduction from one instance of a fair allocation problem to another. Contains
information about the profiles in the reduced instance, through an object of
type `S`. There must exist functions `agents(s::S)` and `items(s::S)` that
return iterators of, respectively, the agents and items in the reduced instance.
The reduction can also contain information about the constraints in the reduced
instance, through an object of type `T`.

In addition, the reduction contains two mappings (vectors), `λi` (of type `I`)
and `λg` (of type `G`). Both types should be indexable (for `i ∈ agents(s)` and
`g ∈ items(s)`, respectively). `λi[i]` and `λg[g]` should return the agent and
item identifier in the original instance of, respectively, agent `i` and item
`g` in the reduced instance.

The reduction also contains a function that can convert an allocation in the
reduced instance to one in the original instance.

The default constructor is `Reduction(V, C, λi, λg, transform::Function)`, for a
profile `V` and constraint `C`.
